Sid Sharma: 
I worked on the forward and backward functions, as well as displaying the output of the puzzle. 
The forward function was the hardest one because it sets the basis for the other functions. 
I tried many different methods, one of which was accurate but not efficient because of how many if loops it used to reset the rows to 0 every time it passed 10 characters. 
However, after trying many different codes, I was able to find one that seems efficient and accurate. 
I split the strings by 10 before going through each row and identifying the word needed to be found. 
Once that was out of the way, I did the exact same thing for the backward function, but instead I flipped the word list instead of the 100-character string.

Hayden: I did the up and down functions and tested that all the functions worked properly. 
Thanks to Sid, I was able to use his forward function and basically just play around with it. 
I was able to integrate his code into the up and down by just transposing the string, which I did with two for loops making the columns into rows. 
I also created the main function to make sure it goes through the entire word search. 
I also tried other methods too to see if there was a better way to do the up and down function, but after Sid did his forward and backward it was simple for me to just use the same concept for a different use. 

BOTH: We both created many input files to test if it was working fine, checking if the column and row numbers match the according positions.
